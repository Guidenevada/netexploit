# netexploit

BEFORE LAUNCHING:
  Be sure you are connected to internet via wifi
  change ip adress in re.php if you want to use the php reverse tcp
  be sure you are using python3
  
  
USAGE:
  python3 netexploit.py 
  if you want use the listener, you have to change ip and port in injector/injector.py and put in your web server an executable file for the target
  


WARNING:
  This program work only with linux with curl installed. You also need to install art with pip
  
  PS. Netcat is highly recommanded while  I develop the listener
  If you don't have these softwares installed, you can instell them with : sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-nmap ncat adb fastboot gnome-terminal -y && pip3 install art && pip3 install termcolor 
  
 
If you want the most recent version, you have to clone the repo, if you want an stable version, you have to download in "Releases" section.


If you want custom payloads, you can make them easily by reading the listener function but if you didn't understand how the listener code work, you can open an issue and/or ask me to make one.


This project:
	is it legal:
		I give you a tool, if you try to hack someone with, it's not my responsibility.
		You have to refer to your country legislation to know if it's legal to use my tool
		in my side, it is totaly legal to develop and use these sort of tool in my country (France)
		

	


code for payload:
	84: connected
	99: print |_| in red
	01: detected os is linux
	02: detected os is Windows
	03: detected os is MacOS
	10: starting hacking
	400: non-compatible os
	401: unknow error
	405: error while downlaoding
	
it's not recommended to use explicit string because if someone try to intercept the signal, it's not too hard to understand what is going on

injector.py :
	how does it work:
		this payload detect the target os and download from your web server at port 80 and:
			for windows:
				download the file named "Windows" and save it as system.exe and execute it
			for Linux:
				download the file named "Linux" execute it
			for MacOS:
				under construction but it will basicly do the same thing as Windows or Linux
			
	What is the result:
		the file to put on your web server is a reverse shell, the reverse shell listener is ncat and it is exactly the same thing as if you listen with netcat and you manualy execute the revese shell in the machine.
